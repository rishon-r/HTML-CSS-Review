    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <pre>
        Forms are a core component of most websites
        In HTML, we can implement forms with the form tag
        The form tag takes some important attributes
        The first important attribute is action
        The action attribute specifies where the data should be sent when the form is submitted
        Another important attribute is the method attribute
        It can take one of two values, either GET or POST
        This is used to represent te method used to send data
        We typically use GET for insensitive data and POST for sensitive data
        The GET method appends data to the URL while the POST method sends data via the request body
        Within the form tag, there may be multiple self closing input tags
        These tags are used to represent input fields in a form
        These tags also take certain important attributes such as type
        The type attribute can take one of many values from the likes of text, password, submit, number, email, submit, radio etc.
        The input tag also takes an attribute called id which is very important in this case.
        Id is self explanatory, it is simply a identification given to the input field
        In practice, input tags are usually used alongside label tags
        Label tags take an attribute called for and this is where we mention the id attribute value of the input tag that the label is being used for.

        Every form must also typically end with a submit button i.e an input field of type submit
        This is so that the user can submit the form
        You can also make an input field mandatory by supplying the required attribute
        This will make that input field a reequired field (i.e you will not be able to submit the form without filling it out)
        The input tag also takes a minLength attribute or maxLength attribute which are self explanatory
        Another cool attribute the input tag takes is a placeholder attribute. Here, you can essentially supply

        <!--Below is an example of using radio buttons in forms. To use them, ensure all radio buttons that are a part of the same component have the same name field-->
        <!--The value of each radio button should be the value you aim to send upon clicking said button-->
        <p> Select your gender: </p>
        <label for="Male"> Male </label>
        <input type="radio" value="Male" id="Male" name="Gender">
        <label for="Female"> Female </label>
