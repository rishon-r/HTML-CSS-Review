            You want to supply a link alongside the href attribute.
            href stands for hypertext reference.
            hypertext is essentially just links between pages.
            Text between the anchor tags appears on the webpage.
            When you click on this text,  you are redirected to the link provided in href attribute of anchor tag.
            target is another attribute of the anchor tag.
            if you set it to _blank, the link will open in a new tab.
            You can also add a title attribute.
            The title attribute in an anchor tag provides additional information about the link. 
            When a user hovers over the link with their mouse, the browser will usually 
            show the title text as a small tooltip.
