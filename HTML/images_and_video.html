        <h3> We can add images to our html pages</h3>

        <pre>
            Images are added to the website with the help of the img tag. 
            We use 4 important attributes alongside it.
            Tese attributes are src, height, width and alt.
            src provides the location of image on computer
            height and width are self explanatory and are provide in units of pixels
            alt provides an alternate text to display during times where we cannot display said image
            another good thing about it is when someone is using a screen reader due to visual impairment,
            the screen reader will read out the message provided in the alt attribute
            Note that img is also a self closing tag.
        </pre>
        
        <img src="/Users/rishon/Projects/HTML_CSS_Review/Images/pexels-lucadross-6793148.jpg" height="200" width="200" alt="Beautiful nature image">
        <br>

        <pre>
            Images can also be sandwiched between an anchor tag in a manner such that they act as a link to something
            In the example given below, clicking on the image of horses redirects you to the wikipedia image of horses
        </pre>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse" target="_blank" title="Horseys">
            <img src="/Users/rishon/Projects/HTML_CSS_Review/Images/pexels-consumedbyjpgs-1662055280-30305200.jpg" height="200" width="200" alt="Cool horse image">
        </a>

        <pre>
            HTML5 also allows you to add videos to your web pages.
            This can be done using the video tag.
            Height and width tags can be used in a manner similar to how they were used withthe images.
            You use the source tag within the video tag in order to add the link to the video
            You can also use the controls and muted property in the video tag in order to give the user some additional control features
            You can also use the autoplay attribute i oreder to autoplay the video
            You can add a backup link to the video by simply adding another source tag within the video tag
            You also use the type attribute of the source tag in order to state what type of video is being referred to 
            You can also sandwich a video within an anchor tag to make it function as a link similar to how we did it with images.
            Due to my laziness however we will refrain from doing this here as the creation method is very similar
        </pre>
        <video width="200px" height="200px" controls autoplay muted>
            <source src="/Users/rishon/Projects/HTML_CSS_Review/Videos/13700775_2160_3840_25fps.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
