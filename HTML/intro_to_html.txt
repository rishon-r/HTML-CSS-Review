HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of web development. It structures content on the web.
- HyperText = Links between pages
- Markup Language = Tags that describe document structure (Tags usually come in pairs)

KEY ELEMENTS
- <!DOCTYPE html>: Declares HTML5. Single tag, does not come in a pair. 
- <html>: Root of HTML document. Between the two html tags is where we will add the rest of our tags
- <head>: Metadata (not displayed). This contains information about our web page such as a the <title> tag. These tags also come in pairs
- <body>: The body element also comes in pairs. It contains all the visible content of your webpage

COMMON TAGS:
