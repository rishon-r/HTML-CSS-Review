    <h1> Span and div tags</h1>
    <pre> 
        An important aspect of html development lies in the understanding of block and inline elements.
        <br>
        Block elements refer to those elements which start on a new line and take up the entire width available
        Block elements can further contain other block and inline elements.
        Examples include div elements, p elements, h1, ul 
        <br>
        Inline elements refer to those elements that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as needed
        Inline elements usually can only contain other inline elements
        Examples include span,  a, and image
        <br>
        The div tag creates a block container for grouping elements
        This is useful when styling with css
        <br>
        Span wraps inline content without altering the layout
        This means can be placed around small bits of text or inline elements without breaking the flow of the surrounding content.
    </pre>
    <br>
    <p> Example of a block with multiple inline elements is given below</p>
    <div>
        
        <span style="background-color: aqua;">
            Hello (inline element 1)
        </span>
        <span style="background-color: tomato;">
            World (inline element 2)
        </span>
        <span style="background-color: rgb(247, 186, 82);">
            I'm (inline element 3)
        </span>
        <span style="background-color: lavender;">
            Inline (inline element 4)
        </span>
        (Block element 1)
    </div>
    <br>
    <div style="background-color: rgb(71, 255, 160);">
        This is a different block from above (Block element 2)
    </div>
    <br>
    <div style="background-color: violet">
        This is also different block from above (Block element 3)
    </div>
</body>
